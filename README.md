This is a demo app for moving from Turbo7 to Turbo8.
It was presented in a meetup talk, so you can find the slides here: https://github.com/ruby-frankfurt/talks/issues/25

This app has multiple stacked branches:
- `main`: Turbo7
- `turbo_8`: changed all Turbo7 features to Turbo8 features
- `native`: stacking Turbo Native & Strada features onto the `turbo_8` branch

It also includes the Rails part of a Turbo Native & Strada integration. You can find the iOS part here:
